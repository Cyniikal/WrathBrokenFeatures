[Void ](https://www.aonprd.com/SchoolDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Void)is an extremely powerful Wizard school in the 1st edition of the Pathfinder TTRPG, and it's one of my personal favorites.

## Added Abilities

***Void Awareness (Su)***: Your ability to recognize the void allows your body to react to magical manifestations before you’re even aware of them. You gain a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. At 20th level, whenever you would be affected by a spell or spell-like ability that allows a saving throw, you can roll twice to save against the effect and take the better result.

***Reveal Weakness (Su)***: When you activate this school power as a standard action, you select a foe within 30 feet. That creature takes a penalty to its AC and on saving throws equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum –1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence bonus.

***Aura of Prescience (Su)***: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of void energy for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Allies within this aura gain a +2 insight bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Along with the corresponding school spells - Many of the spells from the TTRPG simply don't exist. I may work on adding some of these in the future, but for now I've simply selected some that felt right.

## Known Problems

- The game doesn't support elemental schools at the moment, so the opposition element isn't selectable. That makes this school a more powerful choice than it originally was, as you have no opposition school. I'm currently looking into ways to handle this.

***This mod makes use of the utilities/helper methods found in Vek17's excellent [Tabletop Tweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/WrathMods-TabletopTweaks)***

I'm currently playing through the game as a Void Wizard, and things seem to be working well, but take that to mean this mod hasn't been fully tested yet.
